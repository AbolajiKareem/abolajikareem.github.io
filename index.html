        <p>Humans have made significant strides and ground-breaking discoveries during the course of learning about our home planet; Earth; and the universe. But when we look at what we have achieved so far through the lens of how vast the cosmos really is, then one would quickly realize that we've barely scratched the surface of what is to be learnt about the universe.</p>

        <p>However, in the last few decades, spacecraft technology has been rapidly evolving, we've been able to send the first men on a mission to the moon, we've sent missionary robots like the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers to Mars and a few planets in our solar system, we've even launched gigantic telescopes like the hubble space telescopes into space to probe the universe.</p>

        <p>The following is a list of some of most reknowned space agencies in the world:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>NASA</li>
            <li>ESA</li>
            <li>JAXA</li>
            <li>ROSCOSMOS</li>
